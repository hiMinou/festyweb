Our first date is not yet chosen but we plan to do so during the month of may
We will organize stands run by our iut's student ambassadors who will have a budget to 
shop and cook on their own. We help them set up their stands thats why we need ambassadors torepresent 
where there come from (mettre un lien devenir ambassadeur). In fact we will have volunteers to set
 up the decoration. We will need also supprot of the region and the iut because we want to promote diversity.
